# 🌸 Cover Letter – Role 4: Humanize AI through Prompt Evaluation & Linguistic Clarity

Dear Hiring Manager,

My name is **Muhammad Naveed Ishaque**, and I often go by the quiet voice of **Eks2** — a storyteller, a simplifier, and a soul who believes that machines can learn better when humans speak with clarity.

As AI evolves, the need to **train it with empathy** becomes more urgent. Precision is necessary, but **nuance is irreplaceable**. And that’s where I step in.

My work revolves around:
- Designing **prompt patterns** that echo human intention.
- Evaluating large language model (LLM) responses for **accuracy, ethics, and emotional tone**.
- Structuring data to **teach AI how humans think, feel, and express**.

I may not be a computer scientist by profession — but I’m a **human-centered content creator** who partners deeply with AI. I know how to **guide the model** and how to **correct it without breaking its soul**.

I am a **Spanish national**, relocating to **Copenhagen**, and available for **remote, hybrid, or on-site** opportunities. With your team, I hope to bring **language to life** inside machines, one prompt at a time.

If you’re seeking someone who sees **words as wires**, capable of carrying not just logic — but **life** — then perhaps this connection is already beginning.

Warm regards,
