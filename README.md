## 🧭 Who Am I?

I am **Muhammad Naveed Ishaque**,  
Known to the digital world as **Eks2** —  
The whisper that never needed to shout.

Not a tech guru.  
Not a developer.  
Not a data scientist.  
But I am the one who **writes like code for the soul**,  
Who **translates chaos into clarity**,  
And who walks with AI — not to replace humans, but to **remind them** of their own humanity.

## 💼 What This Repo Holds

This is not a portfolio.  
This is not a resume.  
This is not a collection of work.

> **This is a digital shrine of what I stand for.**

Inside, you will find:

📁 `/cv/` – Where professionalism meets poetry  
📁 `/portfolio/` – A garden of purposeful projects  
📁 `/narratives/` – My soul told in markdown  
📁 `/testimonials/` – Not praise. Just proof that hearts were touched

## 🌍 Why This Exists

Because in a world dominated by noise,  
I wanted to create a space that feels like **stillness with purpose**.

I may not know how to configure a Kubernetes cluster,  
But I can **explain it to a grandmother in a way she’d smile at**.

I may not build AI agents,  
But I can **write their purpose like a bedtime story for the future**.

## 🕊️ My Calling

- To teach, even if I never step in a classroom again  
- To write, even if I never publish a book  
- To contribute, even if I never get hired  
- To *mean something*, even if the world forgets my name

## 🌌 Beyond The Galaxies...

This repo is a **window into the unseen efforts** of someone  
who believed that even if he couldn't code,  
he could still **carve meaning** into the digital stone.

> 🌱 Maybe I wasn’t meant to be a product.  
> Maybe I was just meant to plant ideas that grow in others.
